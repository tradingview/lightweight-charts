# Debug Folder

This folder is dedicated to creating and testing debug files that won't be committed to the repository. It provides a safe environment for contributors to experiment and test without impacting the main codebase.
It also offers an easy way to manage multiple sandboxes and includes a default template to help you get started quickly.

## Usage

Before using the package, initialize the common root directory for all experiments by running:

```bash
npm run init
```

### Creating a Sandbox

To create a new sandbox, use the following command:

```bash
npm run create <NAME>
```

Replace `<NAME>` with the desired name for your new sandbox, which will be created under `playground/<NAME>.d`.

By default, the sandbox includes lightweight-charts, typescript, and vite. Additional packages can be installed as needed, and any installed package will be shared across all sandboxes, both existing and future.

### Running a Sandbox

To run a sandbox, use the serve command. This starts a web server, compiles TypeScript, and enables live reload when files change.

```bash
npm run serve <NAME>
```

To run sandbox against production (minified) build of the lightweight-charts:

```bash
npm run serve:prod <NAME>
```

Note: Before running the sandbox, ensure that lightweight-charts is built, as it depends on your local copy.

To rebuild lightweight-charts, run:

```bash
npm run build --prefix ..
```

### Removing a Sandbox

If you need to delete a sandbox, use the following command:

```bash
npm run remove <NAME>
```

This will remove everything under `playground/<NAME>.d`, including the directory itself.
