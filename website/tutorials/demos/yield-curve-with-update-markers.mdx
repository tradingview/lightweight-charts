This sample demonstrates how to create a yield curve chart with real-time
updates using Lightweight Chartsâ„¢. The chart displays two
[yield curves](/docs/next/chart-types#yield-curve-chart) and utilizes the
[UpDownMarkersPrimitive](/docs/next/api/functions/createUpDownMarkers) plugin
to show price change markers for updates.

The chart is initialized with historical yield curve data for two series. By
using the `setInterval` function, we simulate real-time updates to the first
curve. These updates are applied using the `update` method provided by the
UpDownMarkersPrimitive, which automatically handles the creation and display of
markers for price changes.

Key features of this demo:

1. Yield curve chart configuration with custom time range settings.
2. Two line series representing different yield curves.
3. Usage of the UpDownMarkersPrimitive plugin for displaying update markers.
4. Simulated real-time updates to demonstrate dynamic data handling.

The UpDownMarkersPrimitive is attached to the first series when created using
`priceChangeMarkers = createUpDownMarkers(series1)`. We then use
`priceChangeMarkers.setData(curve1)` to initialize the data and
`priceChangeMarkers.update(...)` for subsequent updates. This approach allows
the primitive to manage both the series data and the markers, providing a
seamless way to visualize price changes.
