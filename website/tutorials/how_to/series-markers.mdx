A series marker is an annotation which can be drawn on the chart at a specific point.
It can be used to draw attention to specific events within the data set.
This example shows how to add series markers to your chart.

## Short answer

You can add markers to a series by passing an array of [`seriesMarker`](/docs/api/interfaces/SeriesMarker)
objects to the [`createSeriesMarkers`](/docs/next/api/functions/createSeriesMarkers) method on
an [`ISeriesApi`](/docs/api/interfaces/ISeriesApi) instance.

```js
const markers = [
    {
        time: { year: 2018, month: 12, day: 23 },
        position: 'aboveBar',
        color: '#f68410',
        shape: 'circle',
        text: 'A',
    },
];
createSeriesMarkers(series, markers);
```

You can see a full [working example](#full-example) below.

## Further information

A series marker is an annotation which can be attached to a specific data point within a series.
We don't need to specify a vertical price value but rather only the `time` property since the
marker will determine it's vertical position from the data points values (such as `high` and
`low` in the case of candlestick data) and the specified `position` property ([SeriesMarkerPosition](/docs/api/type-aliases/SeriesMarkerPosition)).
