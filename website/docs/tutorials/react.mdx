title: How to use Lightweight Charts with React
---

On this page you will learn how to easily use Lightweight Charts with React.

The below procedure will use [Parcel](https://github.com/brandiqa/react-parcel-starter) but the dependencies used in package.json will also be provided to start from scratch an empty project.


### Setup your React project - using Parcel

Feel free to reuse the setup details provided by Parcel or to just copy/paste the following

```
git clone git@github.com:brandiqa/react-parcel-starter.git lwc-react
cd lwc-react
npm install
```

### Run your React project

```
// The following will create a web page accessible by default on http://localhost:1234/
npm start
```

### Setup your React project - without a project builder
If for any reason you don't want to rely on a specific builder to construct your project and are only interested in doing things manually you will only need a few dependencies.
```
// package.json
...
"dependencies": {
    "react": "^16.13.1",
    "react-dom": "^16.13.1"
},
"devDependencies": {
	"@babel/core": "^7.10.2",
	"@babel/preset-env": "^7.10.2",
	"@babel/preset-react": "^7.10.1",
}
```
and then
```
npm install
```

### How to create your own Charting React component

The example _React component_ on this page may not fit your requirements completely. Creating a general purpose declarative wrapper for Lightweight Chart's imperative API is a challenge, but hopefully you can adapt this example to your use case.

```javascript
import { createChart } from "lightweight-charts";
import { useEffect, useRef, useState } from "react";

export const ChartComponent = (props) => {
	const { data } = props;

	const chart = useRef();
	const chartContainerRef = useRef();

	const [series, setSeries] = useState();

	const handleResize = () => {
		chart.current.resize(400, 300);
	};

	useEffect(
		() => {
			if (chart.current !== undefined && series !== undefined) {
				series.setData(data);
			}
		},
		[data, series]
	);

	useEffect(
		() => {
			chart.current = createChart(chartContainerRef.current, {
				width: 400,
				height: 300
			});

			const newSeries = chart.current.addAreaSeries();
			setSeries(newSeries);

			window.addEventListener('resize', handleResize);
			return () => {
				window.removeEventListener('resize', handleResize);

				chart.current.remove();
				chart.current = undefined;
			}
		},
		[]
	);

	return (
		<div
			ref={chartContainerRef}
		/>
	);
};

const data = [
	{ time: '2018-12-22', value: 32.51 },
	{ time: '2018-12-23', value: 31.11 },
	{ time: '2018-12-24', value: 27.02 },
	{ time: '2018-12-25', value: 27.32 },
	{ time: '2018-12-26', value: 25.17 },
	{ time: '2018-12-27', value: 28.89 },
	{ time: '2018-12-28', value: 25.46 },
	{ time: '2018-12-29', value: 23.92 },
	{ time: '2018-12-30', value: 22.68 },
	{ time: '2018-12-31', value: 22.67 },
];


export default function App() {
	return (
		<ChartComponent data={data}></ChartComponent>
	);
}

```

and you'll have a reusable component that could then be enhanced, tweaked to meet your needs, adding properties and even functionalities.

If you've successfully followed all the steps you should see something similar to

import { ChartComponent } from "../../src/pages/_react/chart-component"

<ChartComponent/>
