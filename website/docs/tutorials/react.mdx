title: How to with React

On this page you will learn how to easily integrate Lightweight Charts into your React project.

The below procedure will use [Parcel](https://github.com/brandiqa/react-parcel-starter) but the dependencies used in package.json will also be provided to start from scratch an empty project.


### Setup your React project - using Parcel

Feel free to reuse the setup details provided by Parcel or to just copy/paste the following

```
git clone git@github.com:brandiqa/react-parcel-starter.git lwc-react
cd lwc-react
npm install
```

### Run your React project

```
// The following will create a web page accessible by default on http://localhost:1234/
npm start
```

### Setup your React project - without a project builder
If for any reason you don't want to rely on a specific builder to construct your project and are only interested in doing things manually you will only need a few dependencies.
```
// package.json
...
"dependencies": {
    "react": "^16.13.1",
    "react-dom": "^16.13.1"
},
"devDependencies": {
	"@babel/core": "^7.10.2",
	"@babel/preset-env": "^7.10.2",
	"@babel/preset-react": "^7.10.1",
}
```
and then
```
npm install
```

### How to integrate LWC

Whatever the means to setup your project, install the library by:

```
// This will add a line to your package.json dependencies section
npm install --save lightweight-charts
```

Once installed, open your `index.html` and add a new _div_ inside the `<body>` tag
```
// This indicates that the 'container' for the chart will have for size the entirely of the screen
<div id="container" style="position: absolute; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></div>
```

Then modify your main entry point file, like `App.jsx (or .tsx)` and add at the top of the file
```
import { createChart } from 'lightweight-charts';
```

Then declare some data that the chart will use to plot
```
const data = [
	{ time: '2018-12-22', value: 32.51 },
	{ time: '2018-12-23', value: 31.11 },
	{ time: '2018-12-24', value: 27.02 },
	{ time: '2018-12-25', value: 27.32 },
	{ time: '2018-12-26', value: 25.17 },
	{ time: '2018-12-27', value: 28.89 },
	{ time: '2018-12-28', value: 25.46 },
	{ time: '2018-12-29', value: 23.92 },
	{ time: '2018-12-30', value: 22.68 },
	{ time: '2018-12-31', value: 22.67 },
];
```

Finally, inside the main function simply create a chart that will be associated with the container added in the html file.
```
const container = document.getElementById('container');
const chart = createChart(container);
```

By just following the previous steps you won't see much. To actually render a chart you need to add data to some [series](http://localhost:4000/lightweight-charts/docs/series-types)
```
const areaSeries = chart.addAreaSeries();
areaSeries.setData(data);
```

If you've successfully followed all the steps you should see something similar to


import { SetupComponent } from "../../src/pages/react/setup-component.tsx"

<SetupComponent/>
