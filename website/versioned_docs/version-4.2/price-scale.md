# Price scale

Price Scale (or price axis) is a vertical scale that mostly maps prices to coordinates and vice versa.
The rules of converting depend on a price scale mode, a height of the chart and visible part of the data.

By default, chart has 2 predefined price scales: `left` and `right`, and an unlimited number of overlay scales.

Only `left` and `right` price scales could be displayed on the chart, all overlay scales are hidden.

If you want to change `left` price scale, you need to use [`leftPriceScale`](/api/interfaces/ChartOptionsBase.md#leftpricescale) option, to change `right` price scale use [`rightPriceScale`](/api/interfaces/ChartOptionsBase.md#rightpricescale), to change default options for an overlay price scale use [`overlayPriceScales`](/api/interfaces/ChartOptionsBase.md#overlaypricescales) option.

Alternatively, you can use [`IChartApi.priceScale`](/api/interfaces/IChartApi.md#pricescale) method to get an API object of any price scale or [`ISeriesApi.priceScale`](/api/interfaces/ISeriesApi.md#pricescale) to get an API object of series' price scale (the price scale that the series is attached to).

## Creating a price scale

By default a chart has only 2 price scales: `left` and `right`.

If you want to create an overlay price scale, you can simply assign [`priceScaleId`](/api/interfaces/SeriesOptionsCommon.md#pricescaleid) option to a series (note that a value should be differ from `left` and `right`) and a chart will automatically create an overlay price scale with provided ID.
If a price scale with such ID already exists then a series will be attached to this existing price scale.
Further you can use provided price scale ID to get its corresponding API object via [`IChartApi.priceScale`](/api/interfaces/IChartApi.md#pricescale) method.

## Removing a price scale

The default price scales (`left` and `right`) cannot be removed, you can only hide them by setting [`visible`](/api/interfaces/PriceScaleOptions.md#visible) option to `false`.

An overlay price scale exists while there is at least 1 series attached to this price scale.
Thus, to remove an overlay price scale remove all series attached to this price scale.

<!-- Note that this method is not implemented yet :(
## Equality of price scale API objects

`lightweight-charts` library does not guarantee to return the same reference of [`IPriceScaleApi`](/api/interfaces/IPriceScaleApi.md) object for the same price scale ID.
So you should never compare these objects by a reference, use the result from [`IPriceScaleApi.id`](/api/interfaces/IPriceScaleApi.md#id) method instead.
